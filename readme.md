# Code Documentation RAG with Syntax Understanding ü§ñ

An AI-powered chatbot that analyzes any GitHub repository, allowing you to ask questions and understand its code.

## üåü Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help developers and users understand a codebase without having to manually read through all the files. You provide a link to a public GitHub repository, and the application processes its contents‚Äîcode files, documentation, and markdown‚Äîto build a searchable knowledge base. You can then ask questions in natural language about the repository's functionality, implementation details, or specific code snippets.
